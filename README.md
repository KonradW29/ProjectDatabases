For everything to work the database should be called project and run the prompts as normal. The queries are as follows, if you know a goat tag you can enter it and it displays all the goats with the same dam (including the goat that was searched), however if you do not know a goat tag and want to just see a list of goats you can then enter either High, Middle, or Low quality into the drop down menu of the next query. This will display what you will need. To return to the main page from the results page, simply hit the back arrow. On the main page, there is a help button, which when toggled can provide clarifying information to the user.
