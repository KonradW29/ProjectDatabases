For everything to work the database should be called project and run the prompts as normal. 
The queries are as follows, if you know a goat id you can enter it and display that goat as well as its dam(WIP), however if you do not know a goat ID and want to just see a list of goats you can then type eitehr High, Middle, Low quality into the next query.
This will display what you will need.
